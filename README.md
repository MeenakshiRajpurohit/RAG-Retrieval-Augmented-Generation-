# RAG-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-
# 🚀 Production-Ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

This repository implements a scalable, modular Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture designed for real-world AI applications. The system integrates vector-based semantic search with large language models (LLMs) to generate accurate, context-aware, and grounded responses.

Built with production considerations such as modularity, scalability, and performance optimization, this project demonstrates hands-on experience in developing deployable LLM-powered systems.
